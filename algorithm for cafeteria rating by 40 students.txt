		Algorithm
	1. Get input of the 40 students rating the food in the cafeteria.
	2. Create a 1 dimensional array indexed from 0 to 39 to hold the rating by each student in rspective order.
	3. Calculate the average rating.
	4. Create a 2 dimensional array to hold the ratings 1 to 10 with their respective frequencies.
	5. Display the elements of the 1 dimensional array.
	6. Display the average of the ratings that was earlier calculated.
	7. Display the Mode (most common rating)
	8. Display the 2-d array showing rating and how many students made the rating.
	
	
		Variables needed:
	1. students 				- To hold the number of students, which in this case is 40.
	2. max_rating				- The maximum rating which in this case is 10.
	3. cafeteria_rating_array		- 1 dimensional array to hold the rating i.e. cafeteria_rating_array[students][1];
	4. students_counter			- A counter to be used in indexing the cafeteria_rating_array.
	5. total_rating 			- The addition of all ratings to be used in calculation of the average rating.
	6. frequency_array		 	- 2 dimensional array to hold the frequencies i.e. frequency_array[10][2]
	7. frequency_counter			- A counter to be used in indexing the frequency_array.
	8. frequency_count			- Used to count the frequencies of the ratings.
